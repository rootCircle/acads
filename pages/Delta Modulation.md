- Problems of PCM
	- Quantization Error
	- No of Quantization $\rightarrow\infty$ $\implies$ More time & Discrete
- Cons of DM
	- Only for less range of amplitude variation
	- For all values, not matter how high/low it is, send in value is one bit (0, 1)
	- That's where [[Delta Pulse Code Modulation]] comes in
	-
- $\Delta$ = Amplitude(t $_{n+1}$ - Amplitude(t $_n$)
- For $\Delta$ we send 1 for +ve change and 0 for -ve change
