# Process
	- ## Process synchronization
		- Process
			- Cooperative process : Dependent; share variable/memory/buffer/code/resources etc
				- Race conditions -> Synchronization
			- Independent process
		- ### Producer Consumer Problem
			- Producer produces onto buffer and consumer consumes it! Case of race conditions due to shared variable.

		- ### Critical Section
			- Part of program having shared resources accessed by various processes
			- Prefix and Suffix by entry and exit section in program and wait till they are complete, before completing their own's.
			- #### Synchronization Mechanism
				- Mutual Exclusion
				- Progress
				- Bounded Wait
				- No assumption related to H/W and speed
