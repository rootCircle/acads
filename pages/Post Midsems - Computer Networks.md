	- #### Sequence No. (32 bits)
		- ID of first byte of segment
		- Sent from source sending the data
		- ##### Random Sequence No. at start
			- To avoid a packet to be misinterpreted as newer packet after process restart.
			- Like non-received packet(seq no=200) be misinterpreted as newer packet(seq no=200) after immediate process restart.
		- ##### Wrap around sequence no.
			- Wrapping(101 -> 1) sequence no. else max possible data is 2^32 - 1 = around 4 GB.
			- Wrap around time : Time to send 4GB of data in TCP (time after which seq no starts repeating)
				- Wrap around Time = Max Data(4 GB) / Bandwidth
			- Life time : Max time for which a packet is present in the network (generally 180s)
			- Wrap Around Time > Life time else issue in transmission (Older 0th seq no. get interpreted in newer wrapped context)
			- To fix this, we add option field as timestamp(8 bit) with sequence no., hence total data and hence wrap around time increases automatically
	- #### Acknowledgement No.
		- Which next seq no. packet to expect
		- It is _received_ Sequence no + "TCP" Data Size + 1
			- TCP Data Size = IP Packet Size - IP Header - TCP Header as TCP data length is not in headers
		- Sent from sink receiving the data
	- #### Header Length (Data Offset)
