- Power Set of *finite* set only.
- No of Power set = $2^{n}$
- Cartesian Product = m*n
- Relations = $2^{m*n}$
- Identity = Diagonal Relationship
- Reflexive Relation  = $2^{n^2-n}$
- Irreflexive Relation = Doesn't contains any of (x, x) [Not reflexive doesn't imply irreflexive]
- Symmetric = xRy => yRx
- Antisymmetric = xRy => yRx iff x = y (eg <=)
- Asymmetric = xRy it means yRx does not exist
- Transitive = xRy and yRz => xRz
- Equivalence = Reflexive + Symmetric + Transitive
- Partial Ordering Relation (Composite) = Reflexive + Anti symmetric + Transitive
- POSET (Partially ordering Set) = [A;R] (A=Set, R=Partial ordering Relation)
- Totally Ordered Set(TOS) is a POSET in which every pair of element is comparable i.e. aRb or bRa
