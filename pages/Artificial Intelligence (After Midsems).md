- ## Reinforcement Learning
	- Feedback based on environment
	- No labelled data (semi-supervised learning)
	- Maximize positive feedback
	- Used if decision making is sequential and goal is long term
	- Types
		- Positive: Increase frequency and strength of action
		- Negative
	- If complete data is available then classifier is better than it.
